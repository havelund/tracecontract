# tracecontract

TraceContract is an API for trace analysis, implemented in the Scala programming language. 
We argue that for certain forms of trace analysis the best weapon is a high level programming 
language augmented with constructs for temporal reasoning. A trace is a sequence
of events, which may for example be generated by a running program, instrumented
appropriately to generate events. The API supports writing properties in
a notation that combines an advanced form of data parameterized state machines
with temporal logic. The implementation utilizes Scala’s support for defining
internal Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). Furthermore Scala’s combination
of object-oriented and functional programming features, including partial functions
and pattern matching, makes it an ideal host language for such an API.
