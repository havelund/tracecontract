--- Comparing DejaVu and MonPoly: ---

To run experiments, only the following to files are needed:

* dejavu-jars.zip : jar files and script to run dejavu.
* properties.zip : specifications and log files.

The file dejavu-code.zip is for inspection.

The folders obtained by extracting the zip files contain README files in pdf 
format.

In addition to installing DejaVu also MonPoly needs to be installed to make 
the comparison (see website in properties/README.pdf file).
