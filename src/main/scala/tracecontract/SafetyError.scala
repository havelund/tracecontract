/**
 * A safety error represents an error caused by an event occurring that should not occur.
 *
 * An example of a property which can cause a safety error is the following, which states that
 * a command should not be issued more than once:
 *
 * <br>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * class Requirement extends Monitor[Event] {
 *   requirement('CommandAtMostOnce) {
 *     case COMMAND(x) =>
 *       state {
 *         case COMMAND(`x`) => error
 *       }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <br>
 * 
 * A trace of the form <code>COMMAND("A").COMMAND("A")</code>  will for example cause a safety error.
 * 
 * @param monitorName name of monitor in which property resides.
 * @param propertyName name of property violated.
 * @param explanation text provided by the ''informal'' method in class [[tracecontract.Monitor]]. Provides an informal
 * explanation of the property.
 * @param errorTrace the sequence of events that lead to the error, including the violating event.
