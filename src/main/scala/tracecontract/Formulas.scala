  /**
   * Each different kind of formula supported by TraceContract is represented by an object or class that
   * extends this class. The class is abstract so it is itself cannot be instantiated to give a formula.
   *
   * The class offers a collection of methods that can be called with infix
   * notation [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation]].
   * For example, assume two formulas ''f,,1,,'' and ''f,,2,,'' - then it is possible to write formulas of
   * the form:
   * <p><br><p>
   * <pre>
   * // --- propositional logic:
   *
   * f1 and f2
   * f1 or f2
   * f1 implies f2
   *
   * // --- temporal logic:
   *
   * f1 until f2   // f1 must hold until f2 holds, and f2 must eventually hold
   * f1 unless f2  // f1 must hold until f2 holds, but f2 may never hold
   *
   * // --- other operators:
   *
   * f1 then f2    // first f1 shall hold and if becoming true f2 must hold
   * f1 causes f2  // if f1 evaluates to true, then thereafter f2 must hold
   * </pre>
   * <p><br><p>
   * Infix operators with two arguments have <i>short-circuit</i> semantics in the following sense:
   * the operators ''and'', ''or'' and ''implies'' do not evaluate their second argument if
   * the result can be determined from the value of the first argument. For example
   * ''False and p'' will not evaluate ''p'', and ''True or p'' will not evaluare ''p'' neither.
   * Likewise, the operators ''until'' and ''unless'' do not evaluate their first argument if the result can be determined
   * from the second argument.
   * <p>
   * Note that these methods can also be called with traditional object oriented programming dot-notation, as in:
   * <p><br><p>
   * <pre>
   * f1.until(f2)
   * </pre>
