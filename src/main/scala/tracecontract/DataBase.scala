/**
 * This class offers features for defining facts, which can be added to or removed from a fact 
 * database (a set). The database can furthermore be queried for fact membership.
 *
 * Facts are used to model past time temporal properties. We store facts about an execution in order to
 * later be able to query them.
 * 
 * The following example illustrates a specification of the property: 
 * ''"a report about a command name can only be issued if a command with that name has been issued and
 * has not succeeded since then"'':
 * 
 * <br>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * class Requirement extends class Monitor[Event] {
 *   case class Commanded(name: String) extends Fact // declare fact: that a command has been issued
 *   
 *   class Requirement extends Monitor[Event] {
 *     require {
 *       case COMMAND(x)  => Commanded(x) +  // add the fact that x has been commanded
 *       case SUCCESS(x)  => Commanded(x) -  // delete the fact that x has been commanded
 *       case REPORT(x,_) => Commanded(x) ?  // test that x has been commanded
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
