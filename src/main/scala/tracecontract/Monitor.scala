   * example to simplify a specification.
   *
   * <br>
   *
   * As an example, consider the following specification that uses ''select''. The property monitored

   * to occur in the next step. We can allow this since we have filtered out all events that are not commands or successes.
   *
   * The same specification without a call of ''select'' would look as the following more complicated state machine
   * with additional error transitions:

   * <br>
   *
   * <pre>
