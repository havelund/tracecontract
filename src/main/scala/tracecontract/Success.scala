/**
 * A success represents an event that causes a property to be (partially) satisfied.
 *
 * Consider the following property, which states that
 * a command should eventually be followed by a success:
 *
 * <br>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * class Requirement extends Monitor[Event] {
 *   requirement('CommandMustSucceed) {
 *     case COMMAND(x) =>
 *       hot {
 *         case SUCCESS(`x`) => ok
 *       }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <br>
 * 
 * A trace of the form <code>COMMAND("A").SUCCESS("A")</code>  will for example cause a success to be reported 
 * when the second event is observed.
 * 
 * @param monitorName name of monitor in which property resides.
 * @param propertyName name of property that (partially) succeeds.
 * @param explanation text provided by the ''informal'' method in class [[tracecontract.Monitor]]. Provides an informal
 * explanation of the property.
 * @param errorTrace the sequence of events that lead to the success, including the success-triggering event.
