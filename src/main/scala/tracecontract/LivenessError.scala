/**
 * A liveness error represents an error caused by a certain event not occurring in the trace.
 *
 * An example of a property which can cause a liveness error is the following:
 * 
 * <br>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * class Requirement extends Monitor[Event] {
 *   requirement('CommandMustSucceed) {
 *     case COMMAND(x) =>
 *       hot {
 *         case SUCCESS(x) => ok
 *       }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <br>
 * 
 * Suppose for example that a ''COMMAND("A")'' is observed, but no ''SUCCESS("A")'' is observed 
 * thereafter. In this case a liveness error will be produced.
 * 
 * @param monitorName name of monitor in which property resides.
 * @param propertyName name of property violated.
 * @param explanation text provided by the ''informal'' method in class [[tracecontract.Monitor]]. Provides an informal
 * explanation of the property.
 * @param errorTrace the sequence of events that lead to the error. For a liveness property typically the event(s)
 * that caused the expectation of the missing event.
