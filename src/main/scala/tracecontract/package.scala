/**
 * The tracecontract package facilitates analysis of traces. It allows to write what we refer to 
 * as ''trace contracts''. 
 *
 * A trace is a sequence of events, typically produced by a running software system.
 * A trace contract is a class that extends the [[tracecontract.Monitor]] class, and 
 * specifies which traces are  well-formed and which are not. In other words, a trace 
 * contract can be seen as a predicate on traces. A trace contract consists of one or more 
 * properties, where a property is a named ''formula''. The API provides several methods to 
 * construct formulas in various sub-logics, including LTL (Linear Temporal Logic), state 
 * machines, rule-based systems, and liberal combinations thereof.
